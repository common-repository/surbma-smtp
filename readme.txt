External SMTP mail configuration via global variables in wp-config.php.

== Description ==

This plugin is created especially for Multisite Networks. You can define all variables in the wp-config.php file and it will be valid for all sites in a Multisite. So this is not for a site-by-site configuration plugin. You can install it on a single WordPress install also and it will work perfectly. But if you install it in a Multisite Network, you can only network activate it!

This plugin is working with all SMTP servers and services, like Mailgun, SendGrid, Mandrill, Amazon SES and others.

*Required variables:*

- `SURBMA_SMTP_HOST` - External SMTP server.
- `SURBMA_SMTP_USER` - User for the SMTP account.
- `SURBMA_SMTP_PASSWORD` - Password for the SMTP account.

*Optional variables:*

- `SURBMA_SMTP_PORT` - Port number for the SMTP server.
- `SURBMA_SMTP_SECURE` - Choose SSL or TLS, if necessary for your SMTP server.
- `SURBMA_SMTP_FROM` - From email address for all outgoing emails.
- `SURBMA_SMTP_FROMNAME` - From name for all outgoing emails.

*Example configuration:*

    `define('SURBMA_SMTP_HOST','smtp.mailgun.org');`
    `define('SURBMA_SMTP_USER','postmaster@surbma.com');`
    `define('SURBMA_SMTP_PASSWORD','bb2b************************4133');`

You can put these lines everywhere before the line, that says: "That's It. Pencils down"
